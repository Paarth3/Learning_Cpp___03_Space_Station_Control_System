# Concepts learnt and applied in this project
- **If Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`):** The basic decision-making block. Used for checking ranges or complex conditions (e.g., `age >= 18`).
- **Switches (`switch`, `case`, `break`, `default`):** A cleaner way to compare a single variable against many specific values (like a menu selection). Works best with integers or characters.
- **Ternary Operator (`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`):** A shorthand for simple if/else assignments. "If this, then A, else B."
- **Logical Operators:**
    - `&&` (AND): Both conditions must be true.
    - `||` (OR): At least one condition must be true.
    - `!` (NOT): Reverses the condition (True becomes False).
